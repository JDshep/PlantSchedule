plant.cpp   Plant class for storage
main.cpp    primary execution of logic and displays plant watering schedule to the console
Apprentice_WeGrowInTandem_Data.json  Source file for list of plants and days apart from watering


How to Run:

This program was made using QT creator as a QT's console application - can be launchin the latest version of QT creater using the plantSchedule.pro file

to run succsessfully the source files precise location should be replaced in the main file(line 27)

the current date should be writtin in bot main(Line 88) and plant(Line 55) files. the get current date
command seems to be inaccurate and due to lack of time I didnt get it working
